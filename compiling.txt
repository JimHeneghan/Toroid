Hi Jim,

The problem is that your program need a function that is in libgcc.

Use locate to find libgcc (I used libgcc.a which is statically linked but a dynamically linked .so file should do as well):
locate libgcc


Copy the libgcc.a or libgcc.so file to your current directory.

compile with:
gcc -fPIC -c *.c

link with:
 ld -shared -soname doWork.so.1 -o doWork.so.1.0 *.o -L[XXXXXXX] -lgcc

where [XXXXXXX] is the path to your current directory which you can find using the pwd command.

Hope this help,
drd
